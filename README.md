# Financial-Calculator

Developed a comprehensive Financial Calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring tools for Future Value, EMI/Loan, Savings, Mortgage, and Investment Return calculations.


To build a Financial Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I applied a variety of core web development skills, ensuring functionality, user-friendliness, and an appealing design.

First, I used HTML to structure the layout of the calculator. Each section, such as the Future Value, EMI, Savings, Mortgage, and Investment Return calculators, was organized with form inputs, labels, and buttons to ensure a clear and intuitive user interface. Proper semantics were applied to enhance accessibility and SEO performance.

Next, I employed CSS to design the visual aspect of the calculators. The goal was to create a clean and modern interface that would not overwhelm users but guide them smoothly through the input process. I used flexbox for responsive layouts, ensuring that the calculator looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. CSS transitions and hover effects were also integrated to add a layer of interactivity, enhancing the user experience.

Finally, I applied JavaScript to handle the dynamic calculations behind the scenes. I wrote functions to calculate future value, EMI, mortgage payments, savings accumulation, and investment returns. JavaScript was essential in real-time validation of user inputs, as well as providing instant feedback through the display of results. I made sure to implement error handling to ensure robustness, preventing incorrect inputs from breaking the calculation logic.

The culmination of these skills resulted in a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing financial tool. Each calculator is highly interactive and provides accurate outputs, offering users essential insights for their financial planning. This project demonstrates how fundamental web technologies can be combined to build practical, real-world applications that add significant value to users.
